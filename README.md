# Scripts
## A collection of my most useful shell scripts

### Hideicons/Showicons

Hides/shows all icons on the desktop, useful for displaying a clean environment (#ricing) while being
able to access things when I need to.

### Kwm/Unkwm

Uses launchctl to load and unload the [kwm](http://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) window manager. More of a workaround for it not functioning
correctly on my machine, but honestly pretty useful even if it does.
